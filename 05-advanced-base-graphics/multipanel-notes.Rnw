Edward Tufte, \emph{Envisioning Information}:
\begin{quote}
``At the heart of quantitative reasoning is a single question:
\emph{Compared to what?} Small multiple designs, multivariate and data
bountiful, answer directly by visually enforcing comparison of
changes, of difference among objects, of the scope of alternatives.
For a wide range of problems in data presentation, small multiples are
the best design solution.''

\section{Multipanel approaches in R}
To my knowledge, there are five main approaches to multipanel layouts in R.
\begin{description}
  \item[Do them by hand] Manually combine your plots in graphics
    software outside of R. Advantages: you get complete control over
    your layout. Disadvantages: just about everything else. Your
    figure is no longer reproducible. This can become increasingly
    annoying as analyses inevitably get re-run. It can also be
    time-consuming to perfectly line up your panels. I try and avoid
    this at all costs, but occasionally it's your only or best choice.
  \item[grid graphics, \texttt{lattice}, \texttt{ggplot2}] Packages
    like \texttt{ggplot2} and \texttt{lattice} are great. Where I
    think they excel is in exploratory data analysis. You might be
    able to generate ten \texttt{ggplot} figures in the time it would
    take you to do the same in base graphics. Data analysis involves a
    lot of exploratory data plotting, so don't underestimate the value
    of this. Base graphics shine when it comes to plot customization.
    Data presentation for publication often consists of making
    highly-customized plots tailored to your specific situation. I use
    both, but almost always base graphics for publication. Learning a
    \texttt{ggplot2} can be very helpful, but you still need to
    learn base graphics. This workshop will focus on base graphics.
   \item[\texttt{par(mfrow)}] The simplest method in base graphics.
     Works well for simple grid layouts where each panel is the same
     size.
   \item[\texttt{layout()}] In addition to what you can do with
     \texttt{par(mfrow)}, \texttt{layout()} lets you combine panels.
   \item[\texttt{split.screen()}] In addition to what you can do with
     \texttt{par(mfrow)} and \texttt{layout()}, \texttt{split.screen()} lets
     you specify the co-ordinates of your panels. Panels no longer have to be
     simple ratios of each other.
\end{description}

\section{Where I make a silly analogy to explain the increasing levels of complexity}

\texttt{par(mfrow)}, \texttt{layout()}, and \texttt{split.screen()}
are all capable of basic equal-sized-panel grid layouts. If you think
of creating a small multiple layout in R to be like putting screws
into a wall: \texttt{par(mfrow)} would be the equivalent of grabbing
your Leatherman to hang one picture frame --- it's all you need and
it's fast. \texttt{layout()} would be the equivalent of hunting around
for a proper screwdriver to hang a bunch of picture frames.
\texttt{split.screen()} would be the equivalent of finding and plugging
in your power drill --- more of a hassle to set up, but much more
powerful in the end. Don't grab a tool that's more complex than it
needs to be, but don't try and build a house with a Leatherman. 

\section{Questions to ask yourself when making a multipanel plot}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What comparison do I want to emphasize?
  \item How can I use order to enhance the comparison?
  \item Is this a series of plots or does the grid layout matter?
    (\texttt{facet\_wrap} vs.\ \texttt{facet\_grid} in
    \texttt{ggplot2} terminology)
  \item What's a reasonable number of panels to show? Everything? A sample?
  \item Which axes can I fix and which need to vary? Would a log
    transformation be appropriate and allow the axes to be combined?
  \item What chart junk can I remove?
  \item What's important in my plots and what is necessary but less-important
    elements do I want to de-emphasize?
  \item Can I make it all smaller and increase the information density
    without detracting from readability? (Almost always, yes.)
  \item If the layout is complicated, have I drawn it out on paper
    first?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Margin space}

Extra margins are usually wasted space and a break in the comparisons between
panels. You will almost always want to shrink your margins. Set your margins
for each panel with \texttt{mar} and your outer margins with \texttt{oma}. If
all the axes can be shared then set \texttt{mar = c(0,0,0,0)}. These numbers
refer to the space on the bottom, left, top, and right. Then you can use
\texttt{par(oma)} to set your outer margins to create the necessary space for
axes. If your content won't show up in the outer margins, you'll need to set
\texttt{par(xpd = NA)}. See Figure 1 for an illustration of setting margin
space with \texttt{mar} and \texttt{oma}. 

<<demonstrate-mar, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6.0, fig.height=3.3, fig.cap="An illustration of how \\texttt{mar} and \\texttt{oma} interact to create margin space. \\texttt{mar} controls the panel margins and \\texttt{oma} controls the outer plot margins. If you only want axis labels on the outer panels, then you will often set \\texttt{par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))} and only use outer margins.">>=
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(2, 2, 2, 2), oma = c(2,2, 2, 2), bg = "grey75",
  las = 1)
for(i in 1:2) {plot(1, axes = FALSE, type = "n")
  par(xpd = TRUE)
  rect(0.34, 0.34, 1.61, 1.63, col = "grey58", border = NA)
  par(xpd = FALSE)
  rect(-10, -10, 10, 10, col = "white")
    mtext("a", side = 1, line = 0.5)
    mtext("b", side = 2, line = 0.5)
    mtext("c", side = 3, line = 0.5)
    mtext("d", side = 4, line = 0.5)
  if(i == 1){
    mtext("par(mar = c(a, b, c, d),\noma = c(A, B, C, D))", line = -5, cex = 1.0)
  }
}
mtext("A", side = 1, outer = TRUE, line = 0.5)
mtext("B", side = 2, outer = TRUE, line = 0.5)
mtext("C", side = 3, outer = TRUE, line = 0.5)
mtext("D", side = 4, outer = TRUE, line = 0.5)

\section{Ways to iterate through your data}

Common approaches are to use a \texttt{for} loop with subsetting or an
\texttt{apply} function. You could also manually make all your plots, but
unless you were only making a few panels this would get tedious and error prone.

A favourite approach of mine is to use \texttt{d\_ply()} from the
\texttt{plyr} package. This takes a data frame, splits it up, does
something with it (plots it), but doesn't return a value.

\section{Labelling your panels}

There are a number of ways of doing this.\footnote{I describe some other
approaches here:\\ \url{http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/21/panel-letters.html}}
Here, we're going to use this function to add alphabetical labels to our
panels:

<<label-func>>=
#' @param xfrac The fraction over from the left side.
#' @param yfrac The fraction down from the top.
#' @param label The text to label with.
#' @param pos Position to pass to text()
#' @param ... Anything extra to pass to text(), e.g. cex, col.
add_label <- function(xfrac, yfrac, label, pos = 4, ...) {
  u <- par("usr")
  x <- u[1] + xfrac * (u[2] - u[1])
  y <- u[4] - yfrac * (u[4] - u[3])
  text(x, y, label, pos = pos, ...)
}
@

R comes with two built-in character vectors that are useful
for labelling panels:

<<letters-eg>>=
letters[1:8]
LETTERS[1:8]
@

\section{Basic multipanel layouts with \texttt{par(mfrow)}}

For most basic grid layouts, \texttt{par(mfcol)} or
\texttt{par(mfrow)} are your simplest option. \texttt{mfrow} plots row
by row and \texttt{mfcol} plots column by column. \texttt{mfrow} is
therefore likely the most commonly used option. You're going to give
\texttt{mfrow} vector of length two corresponding to the number of
rows followed by the number of columns.

Let's try a basic example with 2 rows and 3 columns:

<<echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6>>=
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
par(cex = 0.75)
par(mar = c(3, 3, 0, 0), oma = c(1,1,1,1))
for(i in 1:6) {
  plot(1, 1, type = "n")
  add_label(0.05, 0.15, letters[i])
}
@

We can eliminate the redundant axes, remove margin space, and reduce
the emphasis on the structural (non-data) elements of the figure.
These are some of the frequent ``tricks'' you can use to create a
basic multipanel layout that will focus the reader's attention on
trends in the data. If you aren't familiar with an option for
\texttt{par()}, look up the help: \texttt{?par}.

<<echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=6>>=
par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
par(cex = 0.75)
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0), oma = c(4, 4, .5, .5))
par(tcl = -0.25, las = 1)
par(mgp = c(2, 0.6, 0))
for(i in 1:6) {
  plot(1, axes = FALSE, type = "n")
  add_label(0.05, 0.1, letters[i], col = "grey50")
  if(i %in% c(4, 5, 6)) axis(1, col = "grey50", col.axis =
    "grey20", at = seq(0.6, 1.2, 0.2))
  if(i %in% c(1, 4)) axis(2, col = "grey50", col.axis =
    "grey20", at = seq(0.6, 1.2, 0.2))
  box(col = "grey50")
}
  mtext("x axis", side = 1, outer = TRUE, cex = 0.8, line =
    2.2, col = "grey20")
  mtext("y axis", side = 2, outer = TRUE, cex = 0.8, line =
    2.2, col = "grey20", las = 0)

\section{Fancy multipanel layouts with \texttt{layout()}}

Say you wanted to make a figure with one wide panel on top and two smaller
panels underneath. We can't do that easily with \texttt{par(mfrow)}?  This is
where \mbox{\texttt{layout()}} becomes useful. It takes a matrix and turns it
into a layout. The shape of the matrix corresponds to individual cells. The
numbers in the matrix correspond to the order of the plots.  Cells with the
same number represent a single panel. I often find it easiest to create a
matrix with \texttt{rbind()} and a series of vectors representing the rows.

First I will use the \texttt{layout.show()} command to see how the figure will
look.  The numbers correspond to the order that the panels will be plotted in.

<<echo=TRUE, results='markup', fig.height=2, fig.width=2>>=
m <- rbind(c(1, 1), c(2, 3))
print(m)
layout(m)
layout.show(3)
@

<<echo=TRUE, results='hide', fig.height=2.5, fig.width=3>>=
layout(m)
par(mar = c(3, 3, 0, 0), cex = 0.7)
for(i in 1:3) {
  plot(1, 1, type = "n")
}
@

You can create some fairly complex layouts with \texttt{layout()} once
you realize that numbers that are higher than the number of plots you
make will be left empty. They can be used to generate margin space.
For example, take this matrix:

<<echo=FALSE, results='markup'>>=
load("cod.crab.layout.rda")
row.names(m) <- NULL
print(m)
@

This matrix can be turned into the layout shown below. Note that there
are only 30 panels that are plotted. The rest of the panels make up
margin space. 

<<echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.0, fig.width=3.9>>=
layout(m)
par(cex = 0.7)
layout.show(50)
@

Here's the finished product:\\

\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{fig/cod-crab-temp.pdf}

This is about as complicated as it's worth getting with \texttt{layout()}. In
fact, this would probably be simpler to accomplish with
\texttt{split.screen()}, which we'll cover next.

\section{Crazy multipanel layouts with \texttt{split.screen()}}

What if you want different panels to be different sizes and the sizes
don't correspond to some simple ratio that you could divide up with
\texttt{layout()}? One common use for this is to keep the unit scales in
different panels the same, without using extra margin space. (In other words, the
ticks are equally spaced on all panels but the panels are different sizes.)
\texttt{split.screen()} is limited only by your imagination and ability to
figure out the co-ordinates of the panels.

\texttt{split.screen()} takes a set of vectors or a matrix to specify the layout.
I typically use the matrix notation. In this case each row describes a
\texttt{screen} with values for left, right, bottom, and
top.\footnote{Note that this is different than the order used in
\texttt{par} statements!} 0 corresponds to the left or bottom of the
plot. 1 corresponds to the top or right of the plot. Sometimes it's
easiest to figure out this matrix in a spreadsheet before and then
read it in as a .csv file.

First let's generate a ``simple'' two-by-two layout with
\texttt{split.screen()}.

<<split.screen-eg, fig.width=3, fig.height=3>>=
m <- rbind(c(0.1, 0.55, 0.55, 1), c(0.55, 1, 0.55, 1), 
  c(0.1, 0.55, 0.1, 0.55), c(0.55, 1, 0.1, 0.55))
split.screen(m)
for(i in 1:4) {
  screen(i)
  par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), cex = 0.7, mgp = c(2, 0.4, 0), las
    = 1, tck = -0.03)
  plot(1, axes = FALSE, type = "n")
  box()
  if(i %in% c(3, 4)) axis(1)
  if(i %in% c(1, 3)) axis(2)
}
close.screen(all.screens = TRUE)
@

Here's an example of setting up the panels to arbitrary sizes so that the
units are equal on both x-axes. I figured out these values in a spreadsheet
first.

<<split.screen-eg-two, fig.height=2, fig.width=4>>=
split.screen(rbind(c(0.1, 0.292, 0.1, 0.98), 
    c(0.312, 0.95, 0.1, 0.98)))
screen(1)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(1, 1, 0, 0), cex = 0.8)
plot(1:30, rnorm(30), xaxs = "i", ylim = c(-3, 3), xaxt = "n")
axis(1, at = seq(0, 30, 20))

screen(2)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), oma = c(1, 1, 0, 0), cex = 0.8)
plot(1:100, rnorm(100), xaxs = "i", ylim = c(-3, 3), yaxt =
  "n", col = "red")
close.screen(all.screens = TRUE)
@

With \texttt{split.screen()} you can apply the same concept to
vertical axes. With a bit of planning you can make fairly elaborate
layouts.\footnote{See Branch et al.\ 2010, Nature, The trophic
fingerprint of marine fisheries, for a great example of this
layout.}\\
