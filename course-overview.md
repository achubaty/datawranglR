# BISC 890-1 Directed Readings: Data Wrangling and Visualization in R

## Course Description
When presenting research "a picture is worth a thousand words", but how do you make that picture as clear and compelling as possible?
The R programming language is predominately known for statistical analysis, but R is also capable of producing publication-quality figures for scientific papers, international newspapers (e.g. The New York Times), and websites.
In addition to its core functionality, sophisticated visualization in R is enhanced by supplemental packages, most notably the `ggplot2` library.
In this course we move beyond basic plotting and highlight some of the more powerful approaches for visualization in R.
Students will learn to rapidly explore their data with the `ggplot2` package and develop highly-customized figures with base graphics functions.
This course will also cover the use of the `plyr` and `reshape2` packages, which are useful tools to format, reshape, and "wrangle" data sets before plotting or analysis.
This course is applicable both to students who have never used R before and those who have used R, but have not accessed its higher-powered data-manipulation and graphing capabilities.
Throughout the course, the exercises and assignments will emphasize reproducible research documentation ("literate programming") in which documentation, code, and figures are combined in the easy-to-learn plain-text language Markdown.

We will meet for 2-hours every two weeks. Students will receive 1 course credit, graded pass/fail. The final grade is determined by completion of assignments and attendance. Assignment will be given at the end of each meeting will be due prior to the following meeting. Attendance is mandatory for a passing grade.
