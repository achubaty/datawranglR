# Data Wragling and Presentation in R

## Student Presentations: Figures

Two minutes per student. Everyone presents their figure from last week's assignment. Minimize the biological background, and focus on what the figure shows and, to a lesser extent, how you made it. Discussion to follow. (Approx. 45-60 minutes)


## Advanced topics

- functions
- maps
- [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/)

### Functions

Writing custom functions in R. (Approx. 20 mins)

- intro to function structure/syntax
    - arguments
    - outputs
- use with `ddply()`
    - e.g., calculate the proportion from counts
    - e.g., return R^2 from `lm()`

### Maps

Introduction to mapping with R. (Approx. 30 mins)

*This won't get into GIS details like choosing projections, etc.*

- built in data
- loading shape files
- plotting maps
- zooming in or highlighting portions of the map
- adding points, colours, etc. to the map.

### R Open Sci

Using open-source tools or data sharing, collaboration, etc.. (Approx. 30 mins)
