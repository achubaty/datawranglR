## Course Organization
- how many students?
- book a room

## Additional Materials
- set up etherpad for collaborative notetaking?
    - this might be a great way for the class to organically take notes
    - allows more advanced students to focus on taking notes and providing clarification while others are focussing on learning the concept- and getting their code to run
    - may also be useful for instructors (after the fact) to see where students were struggling or what wasn't clear
- set up shiny server?
