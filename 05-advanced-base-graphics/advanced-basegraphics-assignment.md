## BISC 888--1 Advanced Base Graphics Assignment

For this last assignment, take some data you're working with for your own research and create a plot with base graphic functions (i.e. no `ggplot2`). If you don't have your own data to work with, then either pick one of the datasets we used during the exercises and assignments in this class, or find another interesting dataset. 

You are free to plot whatever you'd like as long as you fulfil these requirements:

1. The figure must have multiple panels.
2. Use at least two of the following low-level functions: `points`, `segments`, `lines`, `polygons`, `rect`, or `symbols`.
3. Customize the inner (`mar`) and outer margins (`oma`) to avoid extra white space and duplicated axes where appropriate.
4. Set at least two `par` options in addition to setting up the margins.
5. Save your figure to a PDF from within your script. Send us the PDF along with the code to create the figure and the data. If you can't share the data or if the data file is too large (> 1MB), then just send the PDF and the code.
6. To help us understand your beautiful and customized figure, include a brief caption for your figure of approximately the length and style you'd find in a journal (3-4 sentences). You can include this caption in the email you send us.
