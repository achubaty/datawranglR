# BISC 890 Directed Readings - Data Wrangling and Visualization in R

## Course Description
When presenting research "a picture is worth a 1000 words", however how do you make you clear and appealing graphics? The *R* programming language is predominately known for statistical analysis, but *R* is also capable of producing publication quality figures that can be embedded into blogs, and publications. In addition to its core functionality, sophisticated visualization in *R* is enhanced by supplemental packages, most notably the `ggplot2` library. In this course we move beyond basic plotting and highlight some of the more powerful approaches for visualization in *R*. We will explain the syntax for base `plot` and `ggplot2` in order to customize figures. This course will also cover the use of the `plyr` and `reshape2` packages, which are useful tools to format data sets before plotting, or analysis. This course is applicable to all students who those who have never used R before and those who have used R, but have not accessed its higher powered data manipulation and graphing capabilities. This course additionally will cover the basics of making reproducible documents for research purposes, and even blogs using the Markdown markup language.

We will meet 2 hours each week for 6 weeks. Students will receive 1 course credit, graded pass/fail for this course.
