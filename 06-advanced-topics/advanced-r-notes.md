# Data Wragling and Presentation in R

## Advanced topics

- [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/)
- manipulate
- maps

### Functions

Writing custom functions in R. (Approx. 20 mins)

- intro to function structure/syntax
    - arguments
    - outputs
- use with `ddply()`
    - e.g., calculate the proportion from counts
    - e.g., return R^2 from `lm()`

### Manipulate

Introduction to the RStudio-specific `manipulate` package for visualizing data across multiple parameter values.  (Approx. 30 mins)

- parameter values in anylyical models
    - e.g., logistic growth - Ricker model
- useful for data exploration?
    - e.g., bins for histogram
    - e.g., gui for adding layers to plots

### Maps

Introduction to mapping with R. (Approx. 30 mins)

*This won't get into GIS details like choosing projections, etc.*

- built in data
- loading shape files
- plotting maps
- zooming in or highlighting portions of the map
- adding points, colours, etc. to the map.

### R Open Sci

Using open-source tools or data sharing, collaboration, etc.. (Approx. 30 mins)
