`plyr` is an R package that makes it simple to split data apart, do stuff to it, and mash it back together. This is a common data-manipulation step. Importantly, `plyr` makes it easy to control the input and output data format from a syntactically consistent set of functions.

Or, from the documentation:

This is a very quick introduction to `plyr`. For more details see Hadley Wickham's introductory guide The [split-apply-combine strategy for data analysis](http://had.co.nz/plyr/plyr-intro-090510.pdf) (2011, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 40). There’s quite a bit of discussion online in general, and especially on [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/plyr).

Why use `apply` functions instead of `for` loops?
=================================================

1.  The code is cleaner (once you're familiar with the concept). The code can be easier to code and read, and less error prone because:

    (a)  you don't have to deal with subsetting

    (b)  you don't have to deal with saving your results

2.  Apply functions can be faster than for loops, sometimes dramatically.

Why use `plyr` over base `apply` functions?
===========================================

1.  `plyr` has a common syntax — easier to remember

2.  `plyr` requires less code since it takes care of the input and
    output format

3.  `plyr` can be run in parallel — faster

The basic idea behind apply functions
=====================================

`apply` functions work by applying a function to a set of values and
returning the output in some format. Here’s about as simple an example
as possible:

    y <- c(1, 2, 3)
    f <- function(x) x^2
    sapply(y, f)

    [1] 1 4 9

Here, I have applied the function `f` to the values of `y`. Note that
the `sapply` function was unnecessary here. This would have been better
done in a vectorized format. If `y` was large, and the function more
complex, the vectorized format could be noticeably faster.

    f(y)

    [1] 1 4 9

But, it isn't always possible (or easy) to vectorize a function,
particularly when you’re dealing with groupings of data as in the
following examples.

`plyr` basics
=============

`plyr` builds on the built in `apply` functions by giving you control
over the input and output formats and keeping the syntax consistent
across all variations. It also adds some niceties like error processing,
parallel processing, and progress bars.

The basic format is 2 letters followed by `ply()`. The first letter
refers to the format in and the second to the format out.

The 3 main letters are:

1.  `d` = data frame

2.  `a` = array (includes matrices)

3.  `l` = list

So, `ddply` means: take a data frame, split it up, do something to it,
and return a data frame. I find I use this the majority of the time
since I often work with data frames.

`ldply` means: take a list, split it up, do something to it, and return
a data frame. This extends to all combinations. The columns are the
input formats and the rows are the output format:

-----------------------------------------
             data frame   list     array
----------   ------------ -------- ------
data frame   `ddply`      `ldply`  `adply`

list         `dlply`      `llply`  `alply`

array        `daply`      `laply`  `aaply`
-----------------------------------------

I’ve ignored a couple other format options. One that you might find
useful is the underscore (`_`) which will throw away the output
(e.g., `d_ply()`). This can be useful when plotting.


`plyr` provides a consistent and easy-to-work-with format for apply functions with control over the input and output formats. Some of the functionality can be duplicated with base R functions (but with less consistent syntax). Also, few R `apply` functions work directly with data frames as input and output and data frames are a common object class to work with.

Base R `apply` functions (from a presentation given by Hadley):

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     array       data frame    list        nothing
-------------------- ----------- ------------- ----------- --------
array                `apply`     `.`           `.`         `.`

data frame           `.`         `aggregate`   `by`        `.`

list                 `sapply`     `.`           `lapply`    `.`

n replicates         `replicate`  `.`           `replicate` `.`

function arguments   mapply      `.`           `mapply`    `.`
-------------------------------------------------------------------

A general example with `plyr`
=============================

Let’s take a simple example. Take a data frame, split it up (by `year`),
calculate the coefficient of variation of the `count`, and return a data
frame. This could easily be done on one line, but I’m expanding it here
to show the format a more complex function could take.

    set.seed(1) 
    d <- data.frame(year = rep(2000:2002, each = 3), 
    count = round(runif(9, + 0, 20))) 
    print(d)

    year count
    2000 5 
    2000 7   
    2000 11 
    2001 18 
    2001 4 
    2001 18
    2002 19 
    2002 13 
    2002 13

    library(plyr) 
    ddply(d, "year", function(x) {
          mean.count <- mean(x$count)
          sd.count <- sd(x$count)
          cv <- sd.count/mean.count
          data.frame(cv.count = cv)
    })

    year cv.count 
    2000 0.3984848 
    2001 0.6062178 
    2002 0.2309401

`transform` and `summarise`
===========================

It is often convenient to use these functions within `plyr`. `transform`
acts as it would normally as the base R function and modifies an
existing data frame. `summarise` creates a new (usually) condensed data
frame.

    ddply(d, "year", summarise, mean.count = mean(count))

    year mean.count 
    2000 7.666667 
    2001 13.333333
    2002 15.000000

    ddply(d, "year", transform, total.count = sum(count))

    year count total.count 
    2000 5 23 
    2000 7 23 
    2000 11 23 
    2001 18 40
    2001 4 40 
    2001 18 40 
    2002 19 45 
    2002 13 45 
    2002 13 45

Other useful options
====================

Dealing with errors
-------------------

You can use the `failwith` function to control how errors are dealt
with.

    f <- function(x) if (x == 1) stop("Error!") else 1
    safe.f <- failwith(NA, f, quiet = TRUE) 
    llply(1:2, safe.f)

    [[1]] 
    [1] NA
    
    [[2]] 
    [1] 1

Parallel processing
-------------------

In conjunction with `doMC` (or `doSMP` on Windows) you can run your
function separately on each core of your computer. On a dual core
machine this could double your speed in some situations. Set
`.parallel = TRUE`.

    x <- c(1:10)
    wait <- function(i) Sys.sleep(0.1)
    system.time(llply(x, wait))

     user  system elapsed
    0.001   0.001   1.001

    system.time(sapply(x, wait))

     user  system elapsed
    0.001   0.001   1.002

    library(doMC)
    registerDoMC(2)
    system.time(llply(x, wait, .parallel = TRUE))

     user  system elapsed
    0.016   0.010   0.528
